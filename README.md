Automating Nmap Scan
Overview
This script automates the process of running an Nmap scan by first checking if Nmap is installed. If Nmap is not found, it prompts the user to install it. Once installed, the script retrieves the system's IPv4 address and performs a service version scan (-sV) on the detected IP, displaying the results.
